      <p>Hi, I'm Kevin, a student at the Georgia Tech Web Development Bootcamp in Atlanta, GA.</p>
      <p>I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a Finance degree and have worked as a Business Operations
        Analyst for multiple consulting firms within the tech industry. After spending several years in this field, I
        decided I had finally hit the end of the road and want to now pursue a challenging and fulfilling career within
        the Web Development world.</p>
      <p>I grew up in Atlanta and am a huge fan of our professional sports teams, especially the Atlanta Falcons.....who
        always find a way to break my heart each season. But that's okay, there's always next season. My wife and I
        enjoy hiking, traveling around the world, and eating/drinking our way through Atlanta. I also love listening to
        music, watching sports, and cooking partially edible meals.</p>
      <p>To learn more about me, please drop me a message on my Contact page. Thanks for visiting my first website!</p>
